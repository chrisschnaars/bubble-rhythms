# Bubble Rhythms
Bubble Rhythms is a tone-sequencing "game" that enables the user/composer to create a completely unique rhythm of tones. Each Bubble is set to a different note in the A major scale, and will play depending on the Tone Blocks that the user has turned on.

What makes Bubble Rhythms different is that each Bubble is set to its own tempo, which adds a bit of unpredictability to the game and hopefully puts the user in a more experimental creative mindset.

### Using Bubble Tones
In Bubble Rhythms, sounds are made when a Bubble (the colorful moving balls below) intersect with a Tone Block (the gray bars) that has been turned on. To turn a Tone Block on and off, simply click on it.

### Audio Notes
The sounds in Bubble Rhythms are generated via the Web Audio API. The waveform of each sound was found at the [Google Chrome Labs repository](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/tree/gh-pages/samples/audio/wave-tables). The envelope and effects were created by myself.
